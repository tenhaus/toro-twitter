This is the source code for a project I did a few years ago called Toro for Twitter.

The Twitter API had a limit of one feed update every 60 seconds, which in my opinion made third-party clients lame.  I made a page scraper and built a client off of it. This enabled users on Twitter to have near real-time conversations and updates with a third-party application.
